# Machine Learning From Scratch

Building fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python using only NumPy to understand how they work under the hood.

## Purpose

This project focuses on educational implementations of core ML algorithms to build deep intuition about:

- **Supervised Learning**: Classification and regression fundamentals
- **Distance-based methods**: K-Nearest Neighbors, distance metrics
- **Linear models**: Linear regression, gradient descent optimization
- **Neural Networks**: Forward/backward propagation, activation functions
- **Mathematical foundations**: Loss functions, derivatives, matrix operations
- **Training dynamics**: Optimization algorithms, learning rates, convergence

The goal is to implement everything from first principles without relying on ML frameworks, gaining understanding of the underlying system.
